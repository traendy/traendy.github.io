Well-formatted site data should be placed here. The Jekyll engine will
autoload all data files ( using either the .yml, .yaml, .json  or .csv formats
and extensions) in this directory, and they will be accessiblie via 
'site.data': If there is a file memer.yml under the directory, then you can access contents of the fle through site.data.members.
