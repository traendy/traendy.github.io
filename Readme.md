Serve the SitePermalink

Your new website is ready! You can serve the website with `bundle exec jekyll serve` and visit it at http://127.0.0.1:4000. From here, youâ€™re ready to continue developing the site on your own. All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should prefix them with `bundle exec` so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll that is installed in your project folder.
